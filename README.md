# Rubik

This repo contains ansible playbooks for automating commands from 'Kubernetes. The hard way' by Kelsey Hightower. It's written only for personal education. If want to check out my code, please take a look at other repos.

Pay attention that this is under deep development, the code looks really ugly. The only goal is to write these playbooks in declarative way and make it 100% indempotent.

DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION
